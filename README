//Project 2 Gavin Hayes gahayes@wpi.edu CS4513 C16

To compile all projects type 'sh MakeAll.sh' which calls make on both the client and server
To compile one at a time instead enter their respective directories and type make.

For usage messages run either program with -h. Exact same flags as Claypool's example were implemented.
Both programs can run without any options, but in order to specify things like hostname, port, directory, or supply your command at launch
flags must be set.
No login is needed. A username of john and a password of 1234 is hardcoded in both programs. To modify see server.h and the main function in the client main.cpp.
-lcrypt had to be added for the crypt function for g++. Everything else should be on GNU or at least Linux system.

The server was designed to be psuedo telnet compatible for easy testing before I had a client. 
Security is definitely a big deal with programs like these as I left my server running on my computer and came back to 3 HTTP request messages
from bots looking for website admin pages on my server as it was running on 8080. 

Code comments:
C++ strings were used whenever convenient, but c-strings had to be used for *nix functions, especially if the function modified the supplied string.
It would have been nice to  not fork for the exec as the program only runs one command, but if I did that it wouldn't have freed wordexp.

Function summaries: See client.h and server.h


Report - It was interesting to experiment with the cloud server, but isn't practicle yet to do all major computing offsite with the combination
of disk and network speeds mainly. See proj2_report.pdf to see how the tests were done. All tests are included as log files.
Network latency no log see setupandteardown.sh and report.
Network throughput test - ipref.log
cpu tests cpuLocal.log, cpuAmazon.log
io test   ioLocal.log, ioAmazon.log
